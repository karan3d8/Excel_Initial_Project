# Excel_Initial_Project
Thank You for visiting my Profile.

As i am learning excel, I am becoming more and more confident. 
I have started to understand that, Analysis is not about "What?", But analysis is about "Why?".

To make this project, I have followed YouTube video of Alex The Analyst (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJgMj1IUrc).									
In this Project I try to analyze many different aspects based on Gender, Region, Age group and much more.									
I have used Pivot tables to simplify the data ans I use simple graphs for data visualisation.
